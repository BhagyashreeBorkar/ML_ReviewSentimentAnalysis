# ML_ReviewSentimentAnalysis

I have implemented a sentiment analysis project. 
The project is Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis which predict whether the given movie review is a positive review or a negative review. 
Trained my model on the movies reviews dataset, validated on validation dataset and tested on test data set. 
Python Django framework has been used for creating end-to-end functionality.
